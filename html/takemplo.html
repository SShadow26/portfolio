							Give me all the tacos, immediately. Say taco one more time. Tacos, again? This will be 5

							Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with
							pre-cooked shredded
							chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. Can
							you put some
							peppers and onions on that? I think Iâ€™ve overdosed on tacos. Letâ€™s do a beef and a chicken,
							and one with
							both. Give me tacos, or give me death. Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro. How
							bout a gosh darn
							quesadilla? Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo
							seasoning, then
							skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as
							it spins.

							all day. Tacos
